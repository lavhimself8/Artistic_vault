## Project Structure

The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, which organizes code into three main components:

- **Model:** Handles data-related operations, such as database interactions and business logic.
- **View:** Responsible for presenting the user interface and displaying data to users.
- **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, processing user requests, and updating the Model as needed.

- **PHP:** Used for server-side scripting and implementing the backend logic.
- **HTML/CSS:** Markup and styling languages for creating the user interface.
- **MySQL:** Database management system for storing user data and image information.
- **Bootstrap:** Frontend framework for building responsive and mobile-first web projects.
